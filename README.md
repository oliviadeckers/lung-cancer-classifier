Lung Cancer Diagnosis Determination

This repo contains the code and report for a final course project.

The project aimed to perform cluster analysis of any dataset using several machine learning algorithms. The dataset chosen was taken from kaggle.com and contained medical information about patients' symptoms, classifiers, and positive or negative lung cancer diagnoses. We used several machine learning algorithms to train a model and present our results.
